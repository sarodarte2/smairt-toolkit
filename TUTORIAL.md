## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll work through a complete SMAIRT research cycle investigating the question:

> **"How well does a simple decision boundary approach separate two classes under varying noise conditions?"**

We'll follow the scientific method:
- **Background**: What we know about classification
- **Hypothesis**: Our testable prediction
- **Methods**: Code to test the hypothesis
- **Results + Interpretation**: What we found and what it means

SMAIRT uses the **10 Steps** (see `docs/12_STEPS.md`) to keep you rigorous while moving fast with AI assistance. The key innovation is the **audit trail**: every experiment links a hypothesis file → a numbered script → a log file → an analysis document.

### Prime Your AI

**IDE-Native (Roo/Zoo, Cursor, Windsurf):** Your AI can read the project files directly. Start a session with a prompt from `prompts/SESSION_START.md`:

```
Please read prompts/AI_CONTEXT.md, prompts/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md, and prompts/KNOWN_PATTERNS.md.

I'm starting a new SMAIRT project called "Classification Noise Study".
My research question: How does noise affect simple classification boundaries?

I'd like to begin with a baseline experiment on synthetic data.
```

**Browser-Paste (ChatGPT, Claude web):** Run `python scripts/compile_for_ai.py` and paste the output into your chat.

## Phase 1: Synthetic Data

Synthetic data lets us iterate quickly without external dependencies. We control all parameters, making it easy to isolate variables.

### Iteration 1: Establish Baseline

**Step 1 — Write the hypothesis** in `hypotheses/HYPOTHESIS_01.md`:

```markdown
# Hypothesis 01: Baseline Linear Classification

## Statement
A linear decision boundary can achieve >90% accuracy on linearly separable synthetic data with no noise.

## Rationale
With perfectly separable classes in 2D, a linear classifier should perform nearly perfectly. This establishes our baseline.

## Success Criteria
- Accuracy > 90% on test set
- Decision boundary visually separates the classes

## Status: Testing
## Date: [today]
```

**Step 2 — Ask your AI to create the script**:

```
Please create script_01_baseline_no_noise.py in experiments/01_synthetic/ that:

1. Generates 2D synthetic data with two linearly separable classes (200 points each)
2. Fits a simple linear classifier (logistic regression or similar)
3. Reports accuracy, plots the decision boundary
4. Saves the plot to results/figures/
5. Uses TeeLogger to capture output to results/logs/

Hypothesis: HYPOTHESIS_01.md — linear boundary achieves >90% accuracy on clean data.
```

The AI will generate a script following `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`, using `TeeLogger` for the audit trail.

**Step 3 — Run the script**:

```bash
cd classification_noise_study
python experiments/01_synthetic/script_01_baseline_no_noise.py
```

Output is automatically captured to `results/logs/script_01_baseline_no_noise_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`.

**Step 4 — Write the analysis** in `analysis/ANALYSIS_01.md`:

```markdown
# Analysis 01: Baseline No Noise

## Hypothesis
HYPOTHESIS_01.md — Linear boundary achieves >90% on clean data.

## Result
Linear classifier accuracy: 0.98. **Hypothesis SUPPORTED.**

## Interpretation
Clean separation as expected. This establishes our baseline for noise experiments.

## Next Steps
Test with increasing noise levels to find where accuracy degrades.
```

**Step 5 — Track intellectual contribution** in `prompts/intellectual_contribution.md`:

```markdown
## Iteration 01 - Baseline

### What AI Suggested
- Use logistic regression for linear boundary
- Standard train/test split

### What I Contributed
- Decided to start with 2D for visualization
- Chose 200 samples per class as reasonable starting point
- Identified that we need noise testing next
```

> **Note:** If your AI tool has Active Innovation Detection enabled, it will proactively ask you when it notices novel contributions — you don't have to remember to log them yourself.

### Iteration 2: Add Noise

**Write hypothesis** in `hypotheses/HYPOTHESIS_02.md`:

```markdown
# Hypothesis 02: Noise Sensitivity

## Statement
Accuracy will degrade gracefully as Gaussian noise increases, dropping below 90% around noise_std=0.5.

## Rationale
Based on class separation distance in H01, moderate noise should overlap the decision boundary.

## Builds On
HYPOTHESIS_01 (baseline established at 98% accuracy)

## Status: Testing
```

**Create the next script**:

```
Please create script_02_noise_sweep.py that:

1. Uses the same data generation as script_01
2. Adds Gaussian noise with std values: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0]
3. For each noise level, trains classifier and reports accuracy
4. Plots accuracy vs noise level
5. Identifies the threshold where accuracy drops below 90%

Hypothesis: HYPOTHESIS_02.md — Accuracy drops below 90% around noise_std=0.5
```

**Run and analyze**:

```bash
python experiments/01_synthetic/script_02_noise_sweep.py
```

Then write `analysis/ANALYSIS_02.md` with your interpretation. The AI can read the log file directly to help you interpret results.

### Iteration 3: Explore Boundaries

Based on results, you might find the threshold is different than expected. This is where YOUR insight matters:

```markdown
# analysis/ANALYSIS_03.md

## My Contribution - Iteration 03

Results showed accuracy dropped below 90% at noise_std=0.3, not 0.5.

I noticed the classes were closer together than I assumed.
AI suggested increasing class separation, but I realized we should
instead test whether a non-linear boundary helps at the CURRENT separation.

This is a different question than AI suggested — testing boundary
complexity rather than data properties.
```

Add this insight to `prompts/KNOWN_PATTERNS.md` if it becomes a recurring lesson:

```markdown
### 1.X Class Separation vs. Boundary Complexity
**Context**: When accuracy is lower than expected
**Lesson**: Check whether the issue is data overlap or boundary flexibility before adjusting data
```

---

## Phase 2: Downloaded Benchmark Data

Now we validate our findings on real-world benchmark datasets that others have used.

### Transition to Benchmarks

**Document the transition** in a brief plan in `plans/` or update `background/`:

```markdown
# Summary of Synthetic Phase

- Linear boundaries achieve 98% on clean data
- Accuracy degrades to <90% at noise_std=0.3
- Non-linear boundaries provide ~5% improvement at high noise

## Questions for Benchmark Phase

1. Do these patterns hold on real datasets?
2. What noise levels exist in common benchmarks?
3. Are there datasets where linear boundaries fail unexpectedly?
```

### Iteration 4: Download and Characterize Data

```
Please create script_01_download_benchmarks.py in experiments/02_downloaded/ that:

1. Downloads these sklearn datasets: Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer
2. For each dataset:
   - Reports basic statistics (samples, features, classes)
   - Estimates "noise level" via class overlap
   - Tests linear classifier accuracy
3. Saves data to data/downloaded/
4. Creates a summary comparing to our synthetic findings

Hypothesis: HYPOTHESIS_03.md — Linear accuracy >90% on clean datasets,
lower on datasets with more class overlap.
```

### Iteration 5: Validate Noise Findings

```
Please create script_02_benchmark_noise_analysis.py that:

1. Loads the downloaded benchmark datasets
2. For each dataset:
   - Adds artificial noise at levels [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
   - Measures accuracy degradation
   - Compares degradation curve to synthetic results
3. Tests whether our synthetic threshold (0.3) predicts benchmark behavior

Hypothesis: HYPOTHESIS_04.md — Datasets with inherent noise equivalent to
std=0.3 will show similar accuracy to our synthetic experiments.
```

### Document Cross-Validation

Write `analysis/ANALYSIS_05.md`:

```markdown
# Analysis 05: Benchmark Validation Summary

## Findings
- Iris: Linear accuracy 97%, matches synthetic clean data
- Wine: Linear accuracy 91%, some natural class overlap
- Breast Cancer: Linear accuracy 95%, clean separation

## Comparison to Synthetic
Our synthetic noise threshold (0.3) correctly predicted:
- Iris would have high accuracy (low inherent noise)
- Wine would be borderline (moderate inherent noise)

## Limitations Discovered
- 2D synthetic data doesn't capture high-dimensional effects
- Real datasets have non-Gaussian noise patterns

## Known Patterns Update
Added to KNOWN_PATTERNS.md: "High-dimensional data may have lower effective
noise thresholds than 2D synthetics suggest."
```

---

## Phase 3: Real Data

Now apply your validated approach to your actual research data.

### Prepare Real Data

Place your data in `data/real/` and document it:

```markdown
# data/real/README.md

## Dataset: [Your Dataset Name]

**Source**: [Where it came from]
**Samples**: [Number]
**Features**: [Number and description]
**Classes**: [What you're classifying]

**Known characteristics**:
- Expected noise level based on collection method
- Any preprocessing applied
```

### Iteration 6: Apply to Real Data

```
Please create script_01_real_data_baseline.py in experiments/03_real_data/ that:

1. Loads my real dataset from data/real/
2. Applies the same linear classifier we validated
3. Reports accuracy and compares to benchmark expectations
4. Identifies whether results match our noise-accuracy model

Based on synthetic and benchmark phases, I expect:
- If data is clean: >95% accuracy
- If data has moderate noise: 85-95% accuracy
- If data has high noise: <85% accuracy
```

### Iteration 7: Apply Insights

Based on your real data results, apply what you learned:

```
Results show 82% accuracy on real data, suggesting high noise.

From our synthetic experiments, we found non-linear boundaries
improved accuracy by ~5% at high noise levels.

Please create script_02_nonlinear_comparison.py that:
1. Tests non-linear classifiers (SVM with RBF, Random Forest)
2. Compares to linear baseline
3. Determines if the ~5% improvement holds on real data
```

## Compiling Results

### Generate AI Context

When starting a new session or switching AI tools:

```bash
python scripts/compile_for_ai.py
```

This creates a summary of:
- All scripts and their log outputs
- Hypotheses tested and results
- Current state of the research

For **IDE-native** tools, the AI can read these files directly. For **browser-paste**, copy the compiled output into your new session.

### Review the Audit Trail

Your project now contains a complete audit trail:
