# Draft analysis fixture: EXPERIMENT_001 / ITERATION_001

> **Status: unverified fixture.** This document shows the intended record shape. It is not a
> completed human interpretation or evidence decision.

## Executive summary

The deterministic local script reports the fixture's declared Michaelis-Menten parameters and
blank-control result.

## Observed results

The fitted values were Vmax = 120.0 micromoles per minute and Km = 2.50 millimolar. The maximum
absolute blank velocity was 0.1 micromoles per minute.

## Draft interpretation

The reported values match the generating values stored separately from the analysis script. A
reviewer would still need to inspect the inputs, method, run record, and checksums before deciding
whether this result is acceptable evidence for a software smoke test.

## Limitations and confounders

The dataset is synthetic and deliberately well behaved. It demonstrates computational correctness,
not biological discovery or general model adequacy.

## Decision status

No decision has been recorded. The automated smoke script intentionally stops before verification
or acceptance.

## Next steps

Use a real dataset only after defining domain-appropriate controls and uncertainty analysis.
